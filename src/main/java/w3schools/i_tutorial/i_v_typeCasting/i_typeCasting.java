        /*
        Type casting is when you assign a value of one primitive data type to another type. https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_type_casting.asp

        In Java, there are two types of casting:

        1. Widening Casting (automatically) - converting a smaller type to a larger type size
        byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double

        2. Narrowing Casting (manually) - converting a larger type to a smaller size type
        double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte
